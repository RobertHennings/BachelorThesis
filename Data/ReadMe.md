In this folder all the used data can be found, that consists out of the following files and folders:
Since the original CRSP database isnt accessible for me, I tried to replicate it via EIKON equity screening.
1) Folder Listed Equity: 
In this folder there can be found three Excel files from the screening. The screening had to be split up by market cap because EIKON allowed only around                       5000 data points to be downloaded at once. One Excel file contains all the files combined in one big version and only the tickers of the subsuming overview file are saved as .csv.

2) Folder Delisted Equity: 
In this folder there can be found three Excel files from the screening. The screening had to be split up by market cap because EIKON allowed only around                       5000 data points to be downloaded at once. One Excel file contains all the files combined in one big version and only the tickers of the subsuming overview file are saved as .csv.

3) PastorAndStambaughEditedData.csv:
Holds the Pastor and Stambaugh data on the liquidity index and portfolio returns. This file was taken from their personal website where an updated version can be found.

4) ReturnsOnDecilePortfoliosSortedOnHistoricalLiquidityBetas.csv:
This file holds the returns of the decile portfolios that were sorted based on their historical liquidity beta.
This file was taken from their personal website where an updated version can be found.

5) F-F_Research_Data_Factors.csv:
This file holds the famous Fama and French Returns of the three factor model, that serves as a check, if the liquidity risk is already incorporated in one of the included factors or wether it is a new factor.
