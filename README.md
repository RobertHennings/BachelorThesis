# BachelorThesis
The subject of the thesis is the examination of the liquidity risk premium in the U.S. capital market over the period 1920 to 2020. Liquidity risk is analyzed using the Ľuboš Pástor and Robert F. Stambaugh liquidity gamma index, with numerous model modifications and their empirical implications. The statistical significance of the cal- culated liquidity risk premium is affected by the data basis, the data frequency and filtering techniques with regard to the monthly share price. In addition, the time point and the frequency of portfolio rebalancing also show statistical effects that represent robustness tests for the risk premium. The statistical significance of the calculated liquidity risk premium varies across different sub-periods, but can generally be shown to be robust. Analyses of different data frequencies and version controls of the used database may offer further future insight for replication studies and empirical proves.
